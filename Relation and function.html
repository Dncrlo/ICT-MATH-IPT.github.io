<font color= "#3FA8C4 "> <em> Relations and functions </em> </font>define a mapping between two sets (Inputs and Outputs) such that they have ordered pairs of the form (Input, Output). Relation and function are very important concepts in algebra and calculus. They are used widely in mathematics as well as in real life. Let us define each of these terms of relation and function to understand their meaning.
<br>
<br>

<font color= "#3FA8C4"> <b> Relations </b> </font>- A relation R from a non-empty A to a non-empty set B is a subset of the cartesian product A x B. The subset is derived by describing a relationship between the first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in A x B.
<br>
<br>
<font color= "#3FA8C4"> <b> Functions </b> </font>- A relation f from a set A to a set B is said to be a function if every element of set A has one and only one image in set B. In other words, no two distinct elements of B have the same pre-image.

The number of hours spent studying determines the number of exams passed. <b> The students can pass 2 exams for spending 2 hours in studying </b>, Carlo spent 4 hours studying therefore he passed 4 exams, Kayesha 5 hours studying therefore she passed 4 exams, Vera spent 6 hours studying therefore she passed 6 exams, and Rick spent 8.5 hours studying therefore he passed 8 exams.

Elizabeth allowed her kids to shop for candies at the candy store with their allowance. <b> Each piece of candy costs five pesos. </b> Cassidy received Php 20, allowing him to purchase 4 pieces; Gabriel received Php 25, allowing him to purchase 5 pieces; Susie received Php 35, allowing her to purchase Php 7 pieces; Fritz received Php 40, allowing him to purchase 8 pieces; and Jeremy received Php 50, allowing him to purchase 10 pieces.

The number of hours a person can focus depends on how much caffeine they consume. <b> At least 2 hours of concentration can be guaranteed by drinking 0.5 or half a cup of coffee.</b> Diana, on the other hand, is guaranteed 4 hours of concentration after drinking 1 cup; Charles, after drinking 3 cups, is guaranteed 5 hours; and Camilla, after drinking 5 cups, is guaranteed 10 hours.
