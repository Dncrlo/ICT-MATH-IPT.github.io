The domain of a relation is the set of all x-values while the range is the set of all y-values.
<br> <br>
The <b> <font color= "#3FA8C4"> domain <font color= "black"> of a function </b> is the set of values that we are allowed to plug into our function. This set is the x values in a function such as f(x).
<br> <br>
The <b> <font color= "#3FA8C4"> range <font color= "black"> of a function </b> is the set of values that the function assumes. This set is the values that the function shoots out after we plug an x value in. They are the y values.

It refers to the relationship between domain and range in which one element of the domain is mapped to one element of the range.

The amount of money buyers give to the seller determines the amount of scoops of ice cream they receive. 1 scoop of ice cream costs 5 pesos, William payed 10 pesos therefore he received 2 scoops of ice cream, Henry payed 15 pesos but was returned a change of 5 pesos therefore he received 2 scoops of ice cream, and Atsushi payed 20 pesos therefore he received 4 scoops of ice cream.

<font color= "#C85F49"> 2.  Many-to-one correspondence </font> <br> <br>
It refers to the relationship between domain and range in which two or more elements of the domain are mapped to the same element of the range.

The teachers calculated their students average overall and showed the class their grades in the major subjects. The average grade for Science is 89, 92 in English, and 86 in Math.
<br> <b> * Let Science be A, English be B, and Math be C

It refers to the relationship between domain and range in which one element of the domain is mapped to two or more element of the range

For an activity in an 8th grade Mathematics class, the teacher grouped the students into groups of 3. They were to answer 4 questions per group, and work was to be divided between the members as the mapping shows. 
<br>
<b>*Let A be for student 1, B for student 2, and C for student 3

<br>
<font color="#E24141"> Domain of the relation:</font> {A, B, C}
<br>
<font color="#E24141"> Range of the relation:</font> {1, 2, 3, 4} </b>
